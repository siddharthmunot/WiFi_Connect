# WiFi_Connect

Description
 
WiFi Connect establishes peer to peer communication (Call/Chat/Share files) over the Local WiFi Network (WLAN).
Users within the same Wireless Network can discover each other using the Contact list maintained in their respective Smart Phones.
Post discovery, users can communicate (Call/Chat) or Share multiple Files with each other without uploading/downloading to any server.
No Restriction on File type or File size, now you share share full movies/songs with all the peers in the WiFi Network simultaneously and with great speed.
It works by using your phone's Wi-Fi to communicate with other phones on the same network. Or even by forming impromptu networks consisting only of mobile phones.
